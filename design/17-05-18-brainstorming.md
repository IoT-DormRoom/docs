# Brainstorming

## Central Server

- Handles all requests for storing and retrieving data
- Validation will be required and organized by security levels for requests and writes.

## Services

- Services will be individual and self-contained. 
- Services will report to central server data about itself.
- Additional resources that service needs will be requested from the central server.

### Example Services:

- Refrigerator stock
	* Recipes that can be made with ingredients in fridge
- To do list
	* Individual and shared tasks
- Bulletin board/individualized dashboards
- Messaging system
- Lighting system
- Face recognition for when guests come over
- IoT door bell
- Welcome screen
	* Placed on door, could be used to say things like "Do Not Disturb"
